# Hobbiton Themes

This is a set of themes based on the color palette in the Lord of the Rings movies. The colors are not exact matches to the movies, they are intended to evoke cozy hobbit holes with dark earthy tones while still being legable usable themes.

This project is intended for personal use. If you like it, feel free to fork or to expand the library of supported programs on your own. I would be happy to merge them. 

## Under Costruction
